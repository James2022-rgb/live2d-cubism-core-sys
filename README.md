# ü¶Ä Rust FFI bindings for Live2D¬Æ Cubism SDK Core

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Low-level Rust bindings to the Live2D Cubism SDK Core library.

:construction: Very much a WIP project - the public API is going through a *huge* redesign in order to add support for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

SDK version support
----------------------------
|        | Version |
| ------ | ------- |
| Native | 4-r.5.1 |
| Web    | 4-r.5   |

Build target support
----------------------------
|                            | Windows            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`   | :construction: WIP |
| `aarch64-linux-android`    | :construction: WIP |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | :construction: WIP |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown`   | :construction: WIP |

`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` support is not possible, due to Live2D Inc. not providing a binary for this target in the SDK.

Building
----------------------------
An enviroment variable *MUST* be set that that points to an existing Live2D Cubism SDK directory, for _Native_ and _Web_, respectively:
|        | Enviroment variable name       |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Native | `LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_NATIVE_DIR` |
| Web    | `LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_WEB_DIR`    |

e.g.
```
LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_NATIVE_DIR=D:/Development/live2d/CubismSdkForNative-4-r.5.1
LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_WEB_DIR=D:/Development/live2d/CubismSdkForWeb-4-r.5
```

Live2D Cubism SDK Core is included in _Live2D Cubism SDK for Native_, or _Web_, downloaded from:
https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/

Usage
----------------------------

`Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
live2d-cubism-core-sys = { git = "https://github.com/James2022-rgb/live2d-cubism-core-sys" }
```

Rust code:
```rust
unsafe {
  live2d_cubism_core_sys::csmReviveMocInPlace(...);
}
```
