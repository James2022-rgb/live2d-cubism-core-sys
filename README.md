Building
----------------------------
An enviroment variable *MUST* be set that that points to an existing Live2D Cubism SDK directory, for _Native_ and _Web_, respetively:
|        | Enviroment variable name       |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Native | `LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_NATIVE_DIR` |
| Web    | `LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_WEB_DIR`    |

e.g.
```
LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_NATIVE_DIR=D:/Development/live2d/CubismSdkForNative-4-r.5.1
LIVE2D_CUBISM_SDK_WEB_DIR=D:/Development/live2d/CubismSdkForWeb-4-r.5
```

Live2D Cubism SDK Core is included in _Live2D Cubism SDK for Native_, or _Web_, downloaded from:
